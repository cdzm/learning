When I was studying these books, I realized the case on the book.
The folder name corresponds to the title of the book.

/
Data analysis using python/

The folder named by the name of the book contains two folders:data and cases

If there are a few cases in the book, the data in all the chapters is stored in the data directory. If there are many cases, multiple files will be stored in the data directory. The file name corresponds to the chapter number in the book. The final data file name is the serial number of the case in which the data is used.

01_01.data  // few cases

/
01/
01.data    //many cases

The directory structure of cases is the same as data
